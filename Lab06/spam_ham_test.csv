" flow change for fuels cotton valley redeliveries into hpl saturday , march 3 , the redeliveries into hpl from fuels cotton valley for the eastrans deal will increase to approximately 19500 mmbtu / dy . this change should continue through march 5 th or 6 th . the reason for the change is an operational emergency . defs typically delivers approximately 12200 mmbtu / dy into txu lone star . this delivery will not be able to occur because the alford b compressor needs to get into the shop for maintenance . this compressor will be out of commission for the month of march . the busby compressor will compress the usual 7300 mmbtu / dy of fuels cotton valley redelivery gas as well as the 12200 mmbtu / dy of txu lone star redelivery gas . a different redelivery point with txu lone star is being established and should be available by march 5 th or 6 th . at this point in time , we will take the hpl fuels cotton valley redelivery gas to zero and balance the redeliveries between the two points . therefore , defs will not change the delivery or redelivery nominations in place for eastrans . after the new txu lone star redelivery point is put into place and the points are volume balanced , it is our intent to have redeliveries of 7300 mmbtu / dy from fuels cotton valley and 22700 mmbtu / dy into pg & e ( which is what is in place effective 3 / 1 / 01 ) for eastrans .",-1

[ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this . 2 ) the scheduling position window  does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system "" autonoms "" so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ? 3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools . 4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process . 5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard .",-1

" california energy crisis california  , s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues . what happened in california the source of california  , s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california  , s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state . in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state  , s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price . second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt . in short , california  , s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices . at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state  , s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis . enron  , s role many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts  ? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers . ? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states  , utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility . you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a  enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron  , s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services . the solution the solution to california  , s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state  , s utilities . increasing supply california  , s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities . reducing demand customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market . reducing reliance on the spot market in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk . restoring the financial integrity of the state  , s institutions the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed . just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don  , t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse . the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do . as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it  , s important for you to know this  we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state .",-1

" this week ' s woodworking tip . . . follow - up good afternoon ! no , this isn ' t a new tip - just a follow - up on the one i sent this morning . i received some good responses and wanted to pass a couple of them along . kevin wrote to say that this tip works like a charm , except for one thing  he ' s had trouble with the router bit not being perfectly centered on the base , so his dadoes have ended up less than perfect . i referred to this briefly at the end of the tip , but here ' s a quick solution for avoiding the problem . before routing the dado in the gauge , first mark a point on the base of your router . ( i simply add a piece of masking tape since it ' s easy to see . ) then when routing the gauge ( and later , the panel ) , always keep this mark against the straightedge . your dadoes should be right on . another email came in from mike , who suggested making two alignment gauges . then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before you clamp the straightedge fence down . this prevents the "" wiggling "" that often occurs when one end is clamped before the other . great tip ! a big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions . it ' s great to hear that so many people are enjoying the tips . talk to you again in a few weeks . jon garbison on - line editor woodsmith visit our other woodworking and home improvement sites  100 + woodworking plans  woodsmith magazine  shopnotes magazine  workbench magazine  kits , jigs , tools , project plans  back issues  woodworking forums  to change your email address or resubscribe , sign up again at to unsubscribe , send empty email message to  note  your subscribed email address is ",-1

" ngi article on auction ngi ' s daily gas price index breaking news  posted jan 9 , 2  28 pm dynegy not opposed to enron auction ; senate subcommittee to issue 51 subpoenas nearly 20 of bankrupt enron corp . ' s creditors have apparently filed motions to delay the scheduled auction of the company ' s trading assets this week , but one - time merger partner and creditor dynegy corp . will not be one of them , a spokesman said wednesday . however , whether the auction proceeds as planned , enron is facing more obstacles on the legal front with 51 subpoenas requesting documents expected to be issued friday by the senate ' s permanent subcommittee on investigations . the u . s . bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york has been asked by the creditors to delay approving any offer for enron ' s trading business , once the most profitable unit of the company . the motion to delay was requested to allow the creditors time to look at the assets up for sale . included in the auction are assets from its enrononline operation , which enron would like to use in a joint venture with a cash - rich company . under enron ' s proposal , a 51 % joint venture partner would form a new company with enron to be called new energy trading co . , or netco . enron would contribute information technology and back office systems among other things , in exchange for a 49 % stake . as of late monday , ubs ag , citigroup inc . and bp had made bids for some of the assets . among those opposing the auction , now set for thursday with a decision on the winning bids as early as friday , is the royal bank of scotland group plc , which said , "" absent a disclosure of the intended uses for the proceeds of this sale , the creditors are unable to gauge that the benefits are adequate , appropriate and directed to the proper beneficiaries .

" re  sitara release ( re  changes in global due to consent to assignment ) changing counterparty names on sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact to any downstream processes . i hope the following will give more clarification . let me know if you have any questions or need more detail ! thanks , dg 3 - 9517 sitara / unify - process * scenario - counterparty name changes on sitara deal ticket after deal had been pathed , scheduled & bridged back from unify . * impact - zero impact to logistics & volume management , absolutely harmless . settlements has process in place to eliminate issues . * process - counterparty a in sitara changes to counterparty b . ctprty a was on original path sent to pipeline . the new name ( ctprty b ) does bridge over to unify . ctprty a remains at the path level in unify ( gui display does not change ) ctprty b is now displayed at the deal level in unify . the field is now highlighted to indicate a change occurred . ( gui display changes only at high level , not on path ) the scheduler has choice to repath ( if necessary ) , or not re - path if re - pathing occurs , the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path unify pushes back the deal number & meter to sitara ( not ctprty info ) balancing works on deal number & meter only ( not ctprty info ) the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara ( where all information is correct ) volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie - out . ( all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match up perfectly ) settlements utilizes information in unify . settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts , which would create two notification entries if invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty , re - draft would occur . ( note  there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now ) autonoms "" tom ' s words of warning "" - previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after deals were pathed and nominated . basically it would change a key on an edi path ( duns number ) not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline . if the scheduler re - nominated , data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct the problem . in most cases , the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to manually cut the original nominated volume . this is not an issue with unify ( as explained above ) . ( dave - feel free to chime in if i left anything out . ) from  donna greif 04 / 05 / 2000 01  18 pm to  kathryn bussell / hou / ect @ ect , robert cotten / hou / ect @ ect , mark mcclure / hou / ect @ ect , gary l payne / hou / ect , richard pinion / hou / ect @ ect , robert superty / hou / ect @ ect , george smith / hou / ect @ ect , katherine l kelly / hou / ect @ ect , randall l gay / hou / ect @ ect , daren j farmer / hou / ect @ ect , edward terry / hou / ect @ ect cc  dave nommensen / hou / ect @ ect , diane e niestrath / hou / ect @ ect , carrie hollomon / hou / ect @ ect , bryce baxter / hou / ect @ ect , kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect , peggy hedstrom / cal / ect @ ect , dianne seib / cal / ect @ ect , sylvia a campos / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , faye ellis / hou / ect @ ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect @ ect , scott mills / hou / ect @ ect , russ severson / hou / ect @ ect , martha stevens / hou / ect @ ect , karie hastings / hou / ect @ ect , regina perkins / hou / ect @ ect , imelda frayre / hou / ect @ ect , william e kasemervisz / hou / ect @ ect , hunaid engineer / hou / ect @ ect , steven gullion / hou / ect @ ect , larrissa sharma / hou / ect @ ect , thomas engel / hou / ect @ ect subject  re  sitara release ( re  changes in global due to consent to assignment ) fyi . . . . this change went in for the deal validation group . it gives them the ability to change counterparties names after bridge back . impact to logistics - unify if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge backed , it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place . one problem may be with the imbalance data sets , which are not in production yet . . . . . . ( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths ) this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where nominations were sent for entire month ) can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing . unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response . what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? ) i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when these type of changes are needed . will keep you posted . thanks , dg from  thomas engel 04 / 05 / 2000 09  44 am to  kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect , peggy hedstrom / cal / ect @ ect , dianne seib / cal / ect @ ect cc  sylvia a campos / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , faye ellis / hou / ect @ ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect @ ect , scott mills / hou / ect @ ect , russ severson / hou / ect @ ect , martha stevens / hou / ect @ ect , karie hastings / hou / ect @ ect , regina perkins / hou / ect @ ect , imelda frayre / hou / ect @ ect , william e kasemervisz / hou / ect @ ect , hunaid engineer / hou / ect @ ect , steven gullion / hou / ect @ ect , larrissa sharma / hou / ect @ ect , donna greif / hou / ect @ ect subject  sitara release ( re  changes in global due to consent to assignment ) regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution  if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the ability for you to invalidate the deal - and then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message  "" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure pipeline allows this change . "" some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback - i assume for the same reasons we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems ( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal . before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just in case it causes problems with their pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask the unify team . there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im market east - but not from ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be the same legal entity . "" warning - not the same legal entity "" also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals ( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) . once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items were locked down for a reason . if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down data that was validated - and someone used these deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted . always check with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in unify . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by thomas engel / hou / ect on 04 / 05 / 2000 09  47 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from  scott mills on 04 / 04 / 2000 07  38 pm to  kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect cc  steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect , thomas engel / hou / ect @ ect , sylvia a campos / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , faye ellis / hou / ect @ ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect @ ect subject  sitara release ( re  changes in global due to consent to assignment ) with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) . in addition , this release will also capture "" near - time "" the contract changes that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be necessary . new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal manager . new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) . once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you are looking for will appear . i mention "" near - time "" because we are constrained by the amount of time it takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then updates its information srm ( x 33548 ) cyndie balfour - flanagan @ enron 04 / 04 / 2000 03  41 pm to  connie sutton / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , scott mills / hou / ect @ ect , richard elwood / hou / ect @ ect , dave nommensen / hou / ect @ ect , kenneth m harmon / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect , gayle horn / corp / enron @ enron , brant reves / hou / ect @ ect , russell diamond / hou / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect , steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect cc  subject  changes in global due to consent to assignment the following changes will be made in the global contracts database due to receipt of executed consent to assignment for the following contracts  current counterparty name contract type contract # ' new ' counterparty name ces - commonwealth energy services gisb 96029892 commonwealth energy services ces - samuel gary jr . & associates , inc gisb 96029302 samuel gary jr . & associates ces - south jersey gas company gisb 96029143 south jersey gas company cp name change and contract type correction ( contract type different than that provided by ces ) per ces ces - southwest gas corporation 1 / 1 / 98 gisb 96029146 per contract file ces - southwest gas corporation 04 / 14 / 93 master purchase / sale interruptible ( will edit global # 96029146 ) & ces - southwest gas corporation 12 / 01 / 94 master sale firm ( created new global record to accommodate this k , # 96037402 ) please note that southwest gas corporation has consented to the assignment of both of these contracts .",-1

" your specialist ' s appointment starts on the 8 th never agaln minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning . the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season . government spokesman raanan gissin said four soldiers were killed . six people were taken to hospital - - four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military sources said . the sources said another soldier remained beneath the rubble . gissin said rescue operations were continuing sunday night . the attack "" indicates that unless there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . "" shortly after the first blast , a second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not immediately known . hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called the fatah hawks . there was no immediate information available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . israeli military sources said it was a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the post when the explosives were detonated . it was not clear whether there were palestinian casualties . news video of the aftermath showed soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely wounded . in a pamphlet distributed after the attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of the incident . palestinians have used tunnels in the area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard an israeli tank shell exploded in a gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , palestinian medical and security sources said . the children between the ages of 6 and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . the violence happened in khan yunis in central gaza israeli military sources said that forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells being fired towards israeli settlements nearby . in response , the forces fired towards the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military sources said .",1

hurricane / bridgeline status here is a quick status and list of to do ' s related to setting up the new j . v . between enron & texaco which will be combining the lrc and bridgeline pipeline systems  summary  the lrc & bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the name of bridgeline llc . ownership in the jv will be split 60 % texaco & 40 % enron . bridgeline gas marketing llc will be the entity that will be trading on the pipelines under the new j . v . contracts and service agreements are in the process of being drafted . enron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems to support this j . v . texaco will be providing the scada system . i understand that accounting is still being discussed . the trading , risk , & perhaps scheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the 21 st floor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the 3 allen center once a more permanent spot can be built out . trading for the new jv will start in early february for march production . to do ' s  accounting  i ' ve asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture it transition and ongoing costs . texaco is also trying to set up a meeting next monday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same page and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks . pc ' s  jim fussell is in the process of ordering the pc ' s for this jv at my request . i will need the work order numbers to track these costs . networks  i ' m coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that the voice and data networks are in place for eb 21 . once the more permanent spot is nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location . a combination of trader phones , lucent phones , stenfons and amtels have been requested . location on eb 21  i ' m waiting on a call back from chris larson from facilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new jv . currently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall cubes . there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall cubes . we can ' t set up the pc ' s , phones , amtels , etc until this is done . data conversion  i have requested from texaco the contract , deal and meter / facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin trading for march production . it may be possible to get an electronic dump of this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need . we also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios . i will also need to know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the system security . i have received the names of the traders but i don ' t know who else will need access . interface between enron ' s unify pop ' s application and bridgeline ' s scada application  i ' ve asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wright from texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two applications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface . there will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrc ' s rtu ' s / efm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system . in the meantime there will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everything is merged into one . this will probably mean some manual interfaces between pop ' s and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition is complete . scada communications  currently the lrc rtu ' s / efm communicate back to enron ' s scada system via leased lines . bridgelines rtu ' s communicate back to them via a microwave system . the new jv could save on communications costs by switching lrc ' s rtu communication to the microwave . perhaps this is best done as a part of the scada transition . accounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes  this data needs to be better defined . i will follow up with john ledoux from texaco to get this process started . hourly volumes  bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be billed on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing . we need to talk through this process to see what enhancements may be needed . at least initially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the billing for this one customer . please let me know if you ' d like to meet on any of these topics . i can have my assistant set up the meeting if needed . in the mean time i can be reached at 713 - 853 - 6858 . thanks ! - tommy",-1

investigating the merits of entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will position hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market . our primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate pipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the optimal course of action for hpl and for enron . the skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our upstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing operation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business operations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing skills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity opportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to accomplish this objective across n . america . we have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the powder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for processing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the gulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business operations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity . it is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related matters with third parties . please come see me if you have any specific questions or concerns . also please refer any third party inquiries regarding hpl to tim determing . regards , brian",-1
